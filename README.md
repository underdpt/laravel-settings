## Installation
This package can be used in Laravel 5.4 or higher.

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require hackeresq/laravel-settings
```

In Laravel 5.5+ the service provider will automatically get registered and you can skip this step. In older versions of the framework just add the service provider in `config/app.php` file:

```php
'providers' => [
    // ...
    hackerESQ\Settings\SettingsServiceProvider::class,
];
```
The same is true for the alias. If you're running Laravel 5.5+, you can also skip this step. In older versions of the framework just add the alias in `config/app.php` file:

```php
'aliases' => [
    // ...
    'Settings' => hackerESQ\Settings\Facades\Settings::class,
];
```

You can publish [the migration](https://github.com/hackerESQ/settings/blob/master/database/migrations/create_settings_table.php) and [config](https://github.com/hackerESQ/settings/blob/master/config/settings.php) files and migrate the new settings table with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="hackerESQ\Settings\SettingsServiceProvider" && php artisan migrate
```

<b>Success!</b> Settings is now installed!

## Usage

Settings can be accessed using the easy-to-remember Facade, "Settings."

### Set new setting
You can set new settings using the "set" method, which accepts an associative array of one or more key/value pairs.

```php
Settings::set(['firm_name'=>'new']);
```

<b><mark>For security reasons,</mark> this will first check to see if such a setting key exists in your "settings" table or in the cache. If a key does exist, it will set it. If the key does not exist, <i>it will disregard the change.</i> </b> If you want to force set a setting, you can pass true for the second parameter of the set method:

```php
Settings::set(['firm_name'=>'new'],true);
```

If you will be setting variables in the local or development environment and always want to force set settings in that environment, you can do something like this:

```php
Settings::set( ['firm_name'=>'new'] , env('APP_ENV') == 'local' ? true : false );
```


### Get all settings
If no parameters are passed to the "get" method, it will return an array of all settings:

```php
Settings::get();
```

### Get single setting
You can return a single setting by passing a single setting key:

```php
Settings::get('firm_name');
```

### Get certain settings
You can also return a list of specified settings by passing an array of setting keys:

```php
Settings::get(['firm_name','contact_types']);
```

### Check if a setting is set
Sometimes you can't know if a setting has been set or not (mainly boolean settings that will return false if the setting doesn't exists and also if the setting has been set to false).

```php
Settings::has(['firm_name']);
```

## Encryption

You can define keys that should be encrypted automatically within the [config/settings.php](https://github.com/hackerESQ/settings/blob/master/config/settings.php) file. To do so, add the keys as such:

```php
'encrypt' => [
        'twitter_client_id',
        'twitter_client_secret',
    ],
```
